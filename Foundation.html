        <h2 class="Head-Detail"> Before 1930</h2>
        <p class="Paragraph"> Before the World Cup was inaugurated, the football tournament arranged as part of
             the Summer Olympics was given the most prestige. But in the 1920s, the game was
              facing a transition to professionalism that wasn't consistent with the Olympic
               spirit. Therefore, the government body, FIFA, made plans to organize a World Cup.
                The decision of arranging the first edition was officially declared on May 26, 1928.

        <h2 class="Head-Detail"> Unofficial World Cups</h2>
        <p class="Paragraph"> There were, however, unofficial pre-FIFA World Cups already in the late 1800s,
             in a time when only few national teams existed. Another unofficial "world cup" arranged before
              1930 was Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy held in 1909 and 1911. Besides that, the Summer Olympic football
               competitions would be a mark of which the best national teams were before 1930. The Olympic tournaments
                consisted, however, only of amateur teams â€“ the World Cup became the "real deal".
